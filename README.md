# C++ Playground

This repository contains a Visual Studio solution I will use to refresh and showcase my C++ knowledge while progressing from basics to more advanced topics.

- Small/basic learning exercises live here in a single solution.
- Larger or standalone projects will be placed into their own repositories/solutions.

## Structure

```
D:/github/cpp-playground/
?? HelloWorldExample/
   ?? HelloWordExample.cpp
```

As I add more small examples, they will appear under this repository (either as additional projects inside the solution, or as additional folders with build configurations).

## Development Environment

- Visual Studio 2022 (Community)
- MSVC toolset
- C++14 as a baseline (may bump as needed)

## Getting Started

- Open the solution in Visual Studio (or create one if not present yet) and build.
- Add new projects/examples as you learn new topics (use folders like `Basics`, `STL`, `Concurrency`, etc.).

## Goals

- Revisit core C++ language features
- Practice standard library (STL)
- Explore tooling and debugging in Visual Studio

## Notes

This repository is intended to be public so potential employers can track progress over time.
